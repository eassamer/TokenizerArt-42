# NFT Project Documentation

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the creation and deployment of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing the Moonbase Alpha testnet and MetaMask wallet. It incorporates tools such as Remix and OpenZeppelin for efficient and secure smart contract development, while leveraging IPFS through Pinata for decentralized storage. The project showcases NFT visualization through the Rarible testnet platform.

The aim of this project is to explore NFT development best practices and demonstrate the complete lifecycle of NFT creation, from smart contract deployment to marketplace visualization.

## Overview
The project involves the following key aspects:
1. **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum
2. **Testnet**: Moonbase Alpha
3. **Wallet**: MetaMask
4. **Development Tools**: Remix and OpenZeppelin
5. **IPFS Storage**: Pinata
6. **NFT Visualization**: Rarible Testnet
